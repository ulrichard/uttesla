# uttesla
Control your Tesla vehicle from your ubports phone.

[![OpenStore](https://open-store.io/badges/en_US.svg)](https://open-store.io/app/uttesla.ulrichard)

This is a very early alpha. Currently, you have to generate an API key using the [Teslatte CLI](https://crates.io/crates/teslatte) and then copy it to your phone to the file
~/.local/share/uttesla.ulrichard/tesla_access_token.txt

The functionality is very limited at the moment. I plan to add more in the near future.
